# Building a Scalable Documentation Pipeline with Docling

## Detailed Task Breakdown

**Overview:** We outline a series of modular tasks, each of which can be handled independently (and in many cases, in parallel) by separate agents or processes. This design maximizes concurrency and scalability, while ensuring each component has a clear responsibility.

1. **Document Crawling and Acquisition** – *Crawl and fetch source documents reliably.* This involves using a robust crawler (e.g. Scrapy) to gather documents from the specified sources (websites, APIs, file repositories, etc.). The crawler should respect HTTP caching headers to avoid unnecessary downloads: for example, storing and sending `If-None-Match`/`ETag` and `If-Modified-Since` headers on subsequent requests so that unchanged pages return HTTP 304 (not modified). This greatly reduces bandwidth and processing when documentation hasn’t changed. If the source doesn’t provide such headers, the pipeline can fall back to computing a content hash of each page and comparing it to the previous run. The crawling configuration (seed URLs, allowed domains/paths, file type filters, credentials if any) should be externalized in a **YAML/JSON config** so it’s easy to add new documentation sources or adjust crawl depth without code changes. The crawler can output a list of fetched document URLs/paths (with metadata like last modified date or hash) to pass to the next stage.

2. **Docling Integration for Parsing** – *Parse raw documents into structured content using Docling.* Each acquired document is processed with the **Docling** library, which supports **multiple formats** (PDF, DOCX, PPTX, XLSX, HTML, Markdown, images, etc.) and converts them into a unified structured representation. Docling’s `DocumentConverter` can be used to ingest a file or URL and produce a **DoclingDocument** object capturing the full content and layout. This stage yields a consistent JSON (or Markdown) output for each document. Docling’s parsing is quite powerful – it handles complex PDFs (maintaining reading order, tables, code blocks, images, etc.) and can output **lossless JSON** structure that preserves the document hierarchy. By leveraging Docling, we ensure that whether a source document is an HTML page or a scanned PDF, it gets normalized into a structured format that downstream processes can work with. This task can be parallelized: multiple documents can be parsed concurrently on separate threads or workers, especially if CPU or I/O bound. The YAML/JSON config from the crawl stage can also supply parsing options (like skipping certain sections or providing metadata tags for certain sources).

3. **Annotation and Data Enrichment using Docling** – *Augment the parsed content with semantic annotations and metadata.* Docling allows insertion of extra **enrichment steps** in the conversion pipeline for additional insights. For example, if enabled, Docling can analyze code blocks to detect programming languages (`do_code_enrichment`), interpret formulas (`do_formula_enrichment`), classify or caption images (`do_picture_classification` and `do_picture_description`), etc. These enrichments use AI models to tag the content (e.g., labeling a snippet as Python code, or adding a textual description of an image) and populate the DoclingDocument JSON with these details. By toggling these options (usually off by default to save time), the pipeline can produce **rich semantic metadata**: every element in the document (headings, paragraphs, tables, code, figures) can be tagged with its type and even have attributes like identified code language. We should also define a **JSON schema for metadata** to accompany each document – e.g. fields for document title, author, source URL, publication date, etc. Some of this can be extracted automatically by Docling (it *“extracts metadata from the document, such as title, authors, references and language”*). Additional metadata (like a custom doc ID or source name) can be added at this stage. This enriched, annotated JSON output forms the basis for indexing and retrieval. (This task is naturally integrated with parsing; it occurs per document and can also run in parallel for multiple docs.)

4. **Incremental Update and Change Detection** – *Process only new or changed content on each run.* To make the pipeline efficient and **incremental**, it should track which documents have been seen before and whether they’ve changed. Each document’s metadata (from the crawl or parse stage) can be recorded: e.g. storing the last seen ETag or Last-Modified header, or a hash of the content. Before re-processing a document, the pipeline checks these indicators to decide if an update is needed. If a document is unchanged since the last run, we can skip parsing and downstream steps for it (saving computation). For web docs, as noted, leveraging HTTP caching semantics is ideal – many servers will explicitly tell us if content is unmodified. For others, the stored hash comparison is the fallback. We should also maintain a lightweight index (perhaps a CSV or a small database table) mapping each document’s URL (or unique ID) to its last processed hash/etag and timestamp. After processing a doc, update this record. This way, each pipeline run only **ingests new or modified documents**, achieving scalability even as the corpus grows. (This task is a mix of design and implementation: the checking happens at crawl time and/or before parsing each doc. It doesn’t need a separate process, but it is an important logical step.)

5. **Text Chunking and Embedding** – *Segment documents into chunks and generate vector embeddings.* Once a document is parsed (and enriched) into structured text, we break its content into bite-sized **chunks** suitable for retrieval and LLM consumption. Docling provides a **Hierarchical Chunker** that uses the document’s structure to create chunks for each logical element (paragraphs, list items, table rows, etc.), attaching relevant metadata like section headers or captions to each chunk. This yields semantically meaningful chunks (e.g. a paragraph under a specific heading will carry that heading context in metadata). We may apply a **hybrid chunking** approach: first chunk by structure, then if any chunk is still too large (e.g. exceeds a certain token limit), split it further (e.g. by sentence or sub-paragraph) to ensure chunks are of a manageable size for embeddings and retrieval. With chunks in hand, the pipeline then generates **embeddings** for each chunk of text. We should support multiple embedding backends:

   - *OpenAI Embeddings*: Use the OpenAI API (for example, the `text-embedding-ada-002` model) to get 1536‑dimensional vector representations of each chunk. 
   - *Sentence‑Transformers*: Use a local model (e.g. via the `sentence-transformers` library) to embed text. 

   The pipeline could allow configuration to choose the embedding method or even use both. Generating embeddings can be parallelized across chunks (batch API calls or concurrent model inference). The output of this task is a set of `(chunk_vector, chunk_text, chunk_metadata)` tuples for each document chunk, ready to be stored.

6. **Vector Database and Metadata Storage** – *Store chunk embeddings and metadata in a scalable vector index for retrieval.* Options include:

   - *PgVector (Postgres extension)*: store vectors in Postgres, with IVF/HNSW indexes for similarity search. 
   - *Qdrant*: a dedicated high‑performance vector database with rich JSON payloads attached to vectors.

   Key metadata per chunk: document ID, chunk index, source URL, section path, timestamps, embedding model version.

7. **Pipeline Scheduling and Automation** – *Automate regular pipeline runs and environment setup.* Use **GitHub Actions** scheduled workflows (cron) to run the pipeline, install dependencies (ideally via a Docker container), and publish a run summary or Slack alert.

8. **Robust Error Handling, Logging, and Observability** – *Make the pipeline self‑monitoring and resilient.* Emit structured JSON logs from every stage. Forward logs to a central store (GitHub artifacts, ELK, or a SaaS logger). Integrate alerting (email/Slack) for workflow failures and threshold breaches (e.g. >5 % parse errors). Optionally use Sentry for exception tracking.

9. **Provenance, Metadata, and Versioning** – *Track the origin and versions of data.* Tag every chunk with doc ID, source URL, timestamps, and embedding model version. Maintain ver‑sioned document records so changes can be audited or rolled back.

- **Structured JSON logging** with consistent schema (timestamp, task, doc_id, level, msg).  
- **Central log collection** (GH artifacts, ELK, or SaaS logging).  
- **Alerts**: GH Actions notification, Slack webhook, or Sentry integration.  
- **Run summaries**: docs processed/updated/skipped, failures, total time.  
- **Metric tracking**: parse time, embedding latency, vector count growth.  
- **Security**: store secrets in GH Actions, sanitize logs.
